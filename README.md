# Unit 2: Full-Stack!

In this unit, you'll learn about full-stack development which consists of building a backend and layering a frontend on top. We'll build off of the frontend skills from unit one & two so please review those materials.

## Objectives

By the end of this unit, developers should be able to:

* Build a full-stack application
* Build an JSON API
* Understand CRUD and be able to implement it in the backend and frontend
* Adhere to a scalable component architecture
* Have knowledge of working with git version control in a team environment
